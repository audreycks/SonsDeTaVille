# SonsDeTaVille

## What is it?
SonsDeTaVille is a REST API that allows you to find and add sounds located around you. 
The user will be able to add sounds once heÂ·she is logged in and add comments

## Why?
This REST API is developped in the context of the *Web Architecture* course of the 3rd year of Bachelor at HEIG-VD.
This REST API is developped to be then used for another course (*Mobile Development*).

You can find a documentation of our REST API in the files to learn how to use it.
